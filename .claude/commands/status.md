Review the current state of the project and give me a status update:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and check the "Current Status" section
2. Look at the actual codebase and verify what's actually built vs what's marked as done
3. Check for any obvious issues or incomplete implementations
4. Run the app and do a quick smoke test if possible
5. Update the "Current Status" section in CLAUDE.md to accurately reflect what's done

Then tell me:
- What's completed and working
- What's partially done or broken
- What's the next priority task
- Any blockers or concerns

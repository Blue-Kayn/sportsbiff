Build the following feature for the sports betting app:

$ARGUMENTS

Requirements:
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in this project
- Write clean, simple code (this is an MVP)
- Add appropriate validations and error handling
- Test the feature manually before finishing
- Update CLAUDE.md "Current Status" section if completing a major feature

If this requires new models or migrations, create them. If it requires new routes, add them. If it requires new views, build them with Tailwind styling consistent with the rest of the app.

I'm starting a new session and need to understand this project quickly.

Please:
1. Read CLAUDE.md thoroughly
2. Look at the current file structure
3. Check the "Current Status" section to see what's done
4. Look at TASKS.md to understand the overall plan
5. Check git log --oneline -10 to see recent commits

Then give me a quick summary:
- What this project is
- What's already built
- What I should work on next
- Any context I need before continuing

Test the following component or feature:

$ARGUMENTS

Do the following:
1. Start the development server if not running
2. Manually test the feature through the UI
3. Test edge cases and error states
4. Check the Rails logs for any errors or warnings
5. If there are existing tests, run them with `rspec`
6. Report back what works and what doesn't

If you find bugs, list them clearly so I can decide whether to fix them now or later.
